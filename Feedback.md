Hello Vladlena & Lidia,

Here's my feedback on your project. I've included some points for preservation and some points for improvement. I hope you find it helpful.

### Points for Preservation:
1. **Modularity**: The code is nicely modular, making it easier to understand and maintain. Classes and methods are well-defined, serving a clear purpose.
2. **Serialization**: The use of Django Rest Framework's serializers is apt and helps in effective data serialization.
3. **API Views**: Good use of APIView to build RESTful endpoints.

### Points for Improvement:
1. **Error Handling**: Though there's some basic exception handling, the error messages could be more descriptive to make it easier to debug.
2. **Code Comments**: Lack of comments and docstrings. Comments can help understand the purpose and functionality of different code blocks.
3. **Naming Conventions**: Class `Quotes` should ideally be singular (`Quote`) to follow Django's standard naming conventions.
4. **Optimization**: In the `GetRandomquote` class, there are multiple queries to the database that can be optimized.
5. **Front-End**: There are a few inline event listeners in the JavaScript code. Consider separating JavaScript logic and HTML for better maintainability.
6. **Variable Names**: Variable naming in the JavaScript functions could be more descriptive.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further clarification.
